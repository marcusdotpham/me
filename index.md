hi, my name is Marcus Pham.


I write tech books and create online courses. 

All of my books and courses follow principles :

* Make thing as simple as possible
* Always start from beginner
* Focus on practice and code skill
* Working with real life projects
* Idea is explained in short, clear and simple way with graph, image and code example
